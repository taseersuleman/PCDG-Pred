Flow Control Instructions

On the basis of flags, we have implemented Flow contol instructions

In assembly these type of instructions are implemented through Jumps.

There are two types of Jumps.

1. Conditional Jump
	A. Single Flag Jump (if zf = 1)
JC = Jump if carry (CF=1), JZ = jump if  zero (ZF =1), JS jump if signed (SF =1)
JNC = jump if not carry (CF = 0)
JNZ = Jump if not zero (ZF = 0)




	B. Signed Jump (multiple flags )
	C. Unsigned Jump (multiple flags)
2. Unconditional Jump
